## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java SDK (at least version 8)
- Maven (at least version 3.6)
- IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE with Maven support
- Browser drivers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) placed in the system PATH or configured within the project

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE.
3. Run `mvn clean install` to download the dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file.

## Project Structure

- `BaseTest.java` - Contains setup and teardown methods, including WebDriver initialization.
- `LoginTests.java` - Houses test cases related to login functionalities.
- `ProductsTests.java` - Contains test cases for product selection, cart operations, and the checkout process.
- `BrowserTypes.java` - Enumerations for different browser types.
- `SauceDemoUtils.java` - Utility class for commonly used operations like login.
- `CheckoutUtils.java` - Utility class for checkout-related operations.

## Logging

The project utilizes Log4j for logging test events, making it easier to debug issues and understand the flow of test execution. Logs are generated in both console and file outputs for later analysis.

### Logging Library
- **Log4j API**: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api:2.14.1`
- **Log4j Core**: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core:2.17.1`

For configuring Log4j settings, refer to the `log4j2.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory.

## Test Cases

### LoginTests

- **loginWithValidCredentials**: Validates that a user can log in with valid credentials.

### ProductsTests

- **productAddedToShoppingCart_when_addToCart**: Validates adding products to the shopping cart.
- **userDetailsAdded_when_checkoutWithValidInformation**: Validates the user information input during the checkout process.
- **orderCompleted_when_addProduct_and_checkout_withConfirm**: Validates the complete checkout process, from adding products to order confirmation.
